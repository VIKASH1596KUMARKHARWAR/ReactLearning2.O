open source for building the  user interface
not a framework 
focus  on ui
rich ecosystem

component based architecture    
    --reusable code (same component can be used in angular and vue )

react is declarative
    -- tell react u want and react will build the actual ui
    -- react will handel updating and rendering of the components
    -- dom updates are handel gracefully in react

more on why react ??
    -- react doesn't assume the tech u r using, seamlessly integrate into any of ur application
    -- portion of ur  page or a complete page or even an entire application itself
      (one have good knowledge of react ---> switch to react native for mobile app)
