initial pushing on git ::
    git init 
    git branch -m master main

    git remote add origin git@github.com:VIKASH1596KUMARKHARWAR/ReactLearning2.O.git
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"


The error you're encountering is due to Git detecting a potential ownership issue with the directory you're working in. You can resolve this by marking the directory as "safe."

        git config --global --add safe.directory '/media/vikash/data/FSD/React 2.O'
